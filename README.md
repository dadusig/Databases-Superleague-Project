# Superleague - Databases' lab project

This project created as a part of the Databases course lab, during the summer of 2017. 

With my teammate Stavroula Dritsa we had to create a simulation of the greek football league using Java and provide a GUI (in our case, we chose JavaFX). 
For the purpose of the assignment we created a small database filled with some mock data in order to demonstrate the features of our program.

For a more detailed explanation please read the report and the project's assignment file. 

Technologies used in this project:
* Java, JavaFX
* JDBC
* MySQL
* ER, Relational diagrams
